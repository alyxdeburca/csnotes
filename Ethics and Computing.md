		- Faster, cheaper, simpler and more reliable communication
		- Improved access to goods and services
		- Huge improvement in Healthcare
		- Better access to travel
		- Increased safety in travel and other areas
		- Many other positive changes in our way of life
	 - So, it's all good then? -- Mainly, Yes!
	 - However, with all of this Power comes Responsibility
	 - Many decisions to be made in terms of Systems;
		 - Design
		 - Development
		 - Deployment
	 - Important to balance
		 - Needs
		 - Values
		 - Expectations
	 -  Some compromises may be necessary
	 - One size may not fit all Stakeholders
		 - Who is it for?
		 - Who will benefit?
		 - Are anyone's rights being interfered with?
		 - Who owns the system?
		 - Who is responsible for automated **Processes**?
		 - Who is responsible for automated **Decisions**?

		 - Fairness
- Ethics
	- The principles that govern how we lead our lives

- How we examine ethical problems:
	- Outcome
		- Looking at Outcomes can help us discriminate Right from Wrong
	- Social media example:
		- Can have positive outcomes:
			- Social contact, interaction, communication
			- Access to news and information on products and services
			- Leisure and entertainment
		- Can also have negative outcomes:
			- Bullying
			- Antisocial behaviour
			- Mental health issues
	- **Don't throw out the baby with the bath-water**
- Positive values in computing
	- Values can fit many categories:
	- Ethical pluralism
		- Modern world much more connected
		- Many people work in Global teams
		- Global Socio-technical systems
		- Important to understand and respect the values of all
		- Danger of 'Dominant Culture' setting the rules
		- Personal and Professional issue
- Professional codes of ethics
	- Set of guiding principles to
		- ensure ethical behaviour
		- high standard of conduct
	- Public trust in professional integrity
	- Code of ethics quite common
		- Engineers
		- Doctors, nurses
		- Teachers
		- Accountants
		- Computer Scientists
		- Lawyers
	- ACM - Association for Computing Machinery
		- Founded 1947
		- Largest International Organisation
		- Represents
			- Computer scientists
			- Educators
			- Researchers
			- Students
		- Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
			- Updated regularly
			- Last update in 2018
			- Lists general principles
			- Professional responsibilities
			- Professional leadership principles and rules

			1. Contribute to society and to human wellbeing, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
			2. Avoid harm.
			3. Be honest and trustworthy.
			4. Be fair and take actionn not to discriminate.
			5. Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artefacts.

	- Responsibility and Accountability
		- More and more aspects of our lives depend on
			- Computer systems, Hardware, and above all....
			- Software
		- Testing is critically important BUT Expensive and Time-consuming
		- Same goes for training
		- Companies want to get to market quickly and cheaply
		- And these companies can be very powerful and persuasive
		- Politicians and other decision-makers can be lobbied
		- Personal and **Corporate** moral responsibility is important
		- "Computer Error", "Software Glitch" and similar phrases have been used for years to avoid moral responsibility
		- "Depersonalising" somehow avoids human responsibility
		- With the rise in Machine Learning, this needs to change.
		- Someone, somewhere created the Algorithm!
		- Responsibility, Accountability, and Transparency are especially relevant for systems that use machine learning and algorithmic processes for recommendations or decisions
