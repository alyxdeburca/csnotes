Based largely on Chinese Whispers, no formal communication

A system was needed. **Waterfall** technique was brought in from construction/engineering

**Agile** process is iterative and designed specifically for software development but can be more slow to begin with.

## Waterfall Technique

System and Software requirements
<ol>
<li>Analysis: *captured in a product requirement document* </li>
<li>Design: *resulting in models, schema, and business rules* </li>
<li>Coding: *the development, proving, and integration of software*</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Operations</li>
</ol>
Based on engineering and construction project management methodology
Linear process with each stage usually depending on the previous stages(s)
Lots of documentation
Focus on process over prodect

## Agile Technique

The agile software development life cycle is the structured series of stages that a product goes through as it moves from beginning to end.
It contains six phases:
<ol>
<li>concept</li>
<li>inception</li>
<li>iteration</li>
<li>release</li>
<li>maintenance</li>
<li>retirement</li>
</ol>
<br>

<ul>
<li>Flexible, collaborative approach to a software project</li>
<li>Emphasis on the Product rather than the Process</li>
<li>Iteration: when dealing with errors, go back to a prior step and work through the process again</li>
<li>Self-organizing teams - Introspection, Reflective, Mindful!</li>
<li>Simple design</li>
<li>Involve users at every stage</li>
<li>Accept changing requirements as a given</li>
<li>Short "Sprints" to produce "quick wins" and timely feedback</li>
</ul>

### The Agile Manifesto

<ul>
<li>individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
<li>working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
<li>responding to change over following a plan</li>
</ul>

Examples of Agile methodologies include:
<ul>
<li>Scrum</li>
<li>Extreme Programming</li>
<li>Rational Unified Process (More a Business Framework - IBM!)</li>
<li>PRINCE2 - Used in many (UK) Government and public projects</li>
</ul>

## DevOps

<ul>
<li>DevOps is a set of practices combining software development and IT operations</lo>
<li>It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality</li>
<li>DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile way of working</li>
<li>Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and portmanteau) of the terms and concepts for "development" and "operations", academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the term DevOps. </li>
<li>Most often, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow automation, and rapid feedback.</li>
