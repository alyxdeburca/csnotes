# Python Programming

We write code in an IDE/IDLE (Integrated Development Environment)

Our IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (An (Open Source) Microsoft Product)

1. Save all files with .py suffix
This sets the programming language
2. Type code (instructions)
print("text") = to display the word text
3. Save as helloworld.py
4. Run the program in the terminal ·êÖ
(Check the left corner for correct python interpreter)

A string is a list of characters
In our previous example, "text" was the string

If we want to split the string onto two lines, we use /n

\n = new line

```python
Print("Hello World\nI love the weather")
Output:
Hello World
I love the weather
```

\t = new tab

```python
Print("Hello World\tI love the weather")
Output:
Hello World    I love the weather
```
