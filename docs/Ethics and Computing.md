# Ethics and Computing
## Introduction
- Many changes brought about by computing
	- Faster, cheaper, simpler and more reliable communication
	- Improved access to goods and services
	- Huge improvement in Healthcare
	- Better access to travel
	- Increased safety in travel and other areas
	- Many other positive changes in our way of life
 - So, it's all good then? -- Mainly, Yes!
 - However, with all of this Power comes Responsibility
 - Many decisions to be made in terms of Systems;
	 - Design
	 - Development
	 - Deployment
 - Important to balance
	 - Needs
	 - Values
	 - Expectations
 -  Some compromises may be necessary
 - One size may not fit all Stakeholders
	 - Who is it for?
	 - Who will benefit?
	 - Are anyone's rights being interfered with?
	 - Who owns the system?
	 - Who is responsible for automated **Processes**?
	 - Who is responsible for automated **Decisions**?
 - What about,
	 - Freedom of Information?
	 - Right to privacy
	 - Fairness
## Ethics
- The principles that govern how we lead our lives
- Personal and societal views about what is
	- Right and Wrong
	- Just and Unjust
- Ethics are **not**:
	- Laws, Rules, or Regulations
	- A checklist of Do's and Don'ts

## How we examine ethical problems:
- Outcome
	- Looking at Outcomes can help us discriminate Right from Wrong
- Social media example:
	- Can have positive outcomes:
		- Social contact, interaction, communication
		- Access to news and information on products and services
		- Leisure and entertainment
	- Can also have negative outcomes:
		- Bullying
		- Antisocial behaviour
		- Mental health issues
- **Don't throw out the baby with the bath-water**
## Positive values in computing
- Values can fit many categories:
- Ethical pluralism
	- Modern world much more connected
	- Many people work in Global teams
	- Global Socio-technical systems
	- Important to understand and respect the values of all
	- Danger of 'Dominant Culture' setting the rules
	- Personal and Professional issue
## Professional codes of ethics
- Set of guiding principles to
	- ensure ethical behaviour
	- high standard of conduct
- Public trust in professional integrity
- Code of ethics quite common
	- Engineers
	- Doctors, nurses
	- Teachers
	- Accountants
	- Computer Scientists
	- Lawyers
- ### ACM - Association for Computing Machinery
	- Founded 1947
	- Largest International Organisation
	- Represents
		- Computer scientists
		- Educators
		- Researchers
		- Students
	- - #### Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
		- Updated regularly
		- Last update in 2018
		- Lists general principles
		- Professional responsibilities
		- Professional leadership principles and rules
			1. Contribute to society and to human wellbeing, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
			2. Avoid harm.
			3. Be honest and trustworthy.
			4. Be fair and take actionn not to discriminate.
			5. Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artefacts.
			6. Respect privacy.
			7. Honour confidentiality.
	- - #### EU - Ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI:
		- Based on Fundamental Rights and Ethical Principles,
			1. Human agency and oversight.
			2. Technical robustness and safety.
			3. Privacy and data governance.
			4. Transparency.
			5. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness.
			6. Societal and environmental well-being.
			7. Accountability.
## Responsibility and Accountability
- More and more aspects of our lives depend on
	- Computer systems, Hardware, and above all....
	- Software
- Testing is critically important BUT Expensive and Time-consuming
- Same goes for training
- Companies want to get to market quickly and cheaply
- And these companies can be very powerful and persuasive
- Politicians and other decision-makers can be lobbied
- Personal and **Corporate** moral responsibility is important
- "Computer Error", "Software Glitch" and similar phrases have been used for years to avoid moral responsibility
- "Depersonalising" somehow avoids human responsibility
- With the rise in Machine Learning, this needs to change.
- Someone, somewhere created the Algorithm!
- Responsibility, Accountability, and Transparency are especially relevant for systems that use machine learning and algorithmic processes for recommendations or decisions
## Data Protection
- In a Global data network, the rules can get very cloudy...
- ... and Broken
- Companies can claim that they need to use data to provide "the best customer experience"
- Often questions as to the location (jurisdiction) of the data
- Not easy to find and prosecute breaches and abuses
- Data is well hidden from individuals
- Depend on whistle-blowers to highlight misuse and other issues
## Transparency in AI Use
- Many systems use Modelling and Machine Learning to:
	- Analyse purchasing patterns
	- Examine our music, podcast, or video streaming prefences
- This data can be used to predict and suggest future 'needs'
- But in these cases, no big deal if it's not 100% accurate
- However, in some areas accuracy is much more important
- Health-related applications like cancer screening demand
	- Accurate and reliable data - both training and real-time
	- Transparency with regard to data and the decision-making process
	- Exhaustive (and on-going) testing of the algorithm
	- End-user (medical professionals) engagement and feedback
- Medical ethics require clinical decisions to be based on
	- Transparency
	- Accountability
	- Explainability
- Who or what is responsible for the decision?
	- Should be the medical professional - supported by Machine Learning
- Not all medical conditions are equal in terms of 
	- Research (and Research funding)
	- Big Pharma support (drugs and research)
- Priority given to more affluent societies and illnesses
	- "Diseases of the rich!"
	- Better ($$$) results for the pharma companies
- Example of... Heart-disease (better cash-flow)
- Not all groups are represented equally in the data
	- Women have traditionally been excluded from research trials
	- Less affluent societies have been (somewhat) ignored
- So, less acccurate data available for these demographics
- Symptoms can be misinterpreted and diseases left untreated
- These inaccuracies (bias) can cause imbalance in the use of ML
	- Favouring certain diseases and demographics
	- Exacerbate inequalities in healthcare
- This lack of transparency can affect the uses of AI in healthcare
- Bias in AI - Image and facial recognition
## Data quality
- ### One of the biggest problems in ML
	- Poor quality data = poor quality models - GIGO
	- Note quote from (1700s) - so this is not new
	- Typical issues:
		- Missing values (gaps)
		- Outliers
		- Imbalanced data
	- - #### Bias:
		- Very serious issue in ML datasets
		- Biased data leads to biased models
		- US Healthcare model example - racial bias
		- Misplaced trust in machine-based decisions
		- But it's the training dataset that matters
		- Racial, socio-economic or gender are the main issues
		- Problem with black-box algorithms - data is not transparent
		- Can lead to questions of trust
	- - #### Bias in AI - Image and facial recognition
		- Huge training data-sets created by humans
		- ImageNet Large image-recognition training library
			- Images harvested from web searches over 10-year period
			- Labelled by team of people and fed to a ML algorithm
			- Seemed to be highly accurate at first
			- Later shown to contain 'disturbing biases'
			- Description tags may be correct but open to error / abuse
			- Subjective descriptions can include bias in terms of:
				- Political 
				- Cultural
				- Social
			- These biases can be conscious or unconscious
		- ML also requires classification according to values like:
			- Gender
			- Nationality
			- Ethnicity
			- Etc...
		- This can be problematic - and even inaccurate
		- Data-sets are often imbalanced in terms of gender, race, etc.
		- Many facial recognition systems are only useful when presented with images of white males
		- Struggle with women and people of colour
		- The Gender Shades Project - Joy Boulamwini, MIT
			- Identify bias in gender classification in different AI facial recognition projects
		- What's the big deal anyway?
		- Facial recognition is growing at an alarming rate
		- Unlocking your phone, boarding a plane
		- Government agencies
		- Police forces starting to use them
		- Gardai looking for facial recognition on Bodycams
		- But the quality doesn't seem to be keeping up
		- Not yet fit for purpose - Still too much room for error
		- 2020 - Microsoft, Amazon, et. al. paused development of facial recognition software for policing - citing the need for stronger regulations (and more accuracy!)
		- Ethical concerns? Maybe
		- Fear of litigation? Definitely!
	- ##Fairness and justice
		- ML systems often deployed for 'efficiency'
			- Data mined from many sources - even Public Service data
			- Can affect access to services and even Human Rights
			- These systems are often in use 'behind-the-scenes' in
				- Banking (Credit checking, Loan approval, etc.)
				- Justice system (Bail application)
				- Insurance (Risks, Actuarial data, etc.)
			- Little known of their algorithm (black-box) or training data
		- Car Insurance and ML algorithms
			- Previously used Actuarial data to assess risks
			- Data related to
				- Vehicle (age, engine size, condition, value, etc.)
				- Address (risk of theft or other damage)
				- Driver(s) (age profile, previous claims, etc.)
				- Occupation (Likely mileage, occupational risks, etc.)
			- And this was all very reasonable
			- However, they now have access to other data such as:
				- Financial data
				- Advertising and Cookie tracing
				- Social network posts
				- Purchasing data
			- WHY???? - Price Optimisation
			- Price Optimisation???
				- What you would be willing to pay!
				- Data is also used to fine-tune the Risk calculation
			- Data often obtained 'by stealth'
			- Gives them an unfair advantages
			- Algorithmic decision making in Criminal Justice
				- Used in USA and other countries
				- Decisions once made by Police, Judges and Juries now made by Machine Learning systems
				- For criminal offences, ML systems can recommend:
					- Profiling
					- Arrest
					- Sentencing
				- COMPAS - Sounds like a great idea!
					- However, it has been found to have bias
					- Seriously overestimates the risk of reoffending for people from more disadvantaged backgrounds
					- Most bias shown against ethnic minorities
				- Why this?
					- Data used was mainly socio-economic - based on
						- Employment history
						- Education
						- Family Health
						- "Known to the Police"
				- COMPAS - has been found to have bias - Why is this?
				- More affluent - but more serious criminals judged to be less at risk of reoffending!
				- Decision systems using Aggregated data more likely to replicate inequality - why?
					- Data-sets reflect the structures of society and
					- Society is unequal
				- Data aggregation is any process whereby data is gathered and expressed in a summary form. When data is aggregated, atomic data rows - typically gathered from multiple sources are replaced with aggregated totals
				- What can we do about these inaccuracies and biases?
					- Regulate training data sets
					- Data cooperatives to design training data from scratch
				- This should make algorithmic decision making
					- More transparent
					- More representative
					- More respected and trusted
## Socio-technical systems
	- Computer systems can't exist without an ecosystem
	- Social, economic, and political support structures
	- For example, for computing we need
		- Electricity networks
		- Internet connections
		- WiFi and Communications networks
		- Payment systems
		- Agreements, Laws, and Standards
	- Computing is a socio-technical system
		- More than the hardware and software
		- Shaped and supported by relationships and agreements
			- Social
			- Economic
			- Political
		- These are based on a set of Values
		- To date, mainly White, Middle-class males have shaped the computing landscape
		- Examples of 'shapers' include:
			- Steve Jobs & Wozniak (Apple)
			- Bill Gates (Microsoft)
			- Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook)
		- Notice a pattern?
		- Deborah Johnson (IT Ethicist) certainly did.
	- Software (and System) design reflects prevailing context and culture
	- It's possible that in future, more diversity within computing will create different 'shapes'
	- May move to a more altruistic less commercial model
	- Less emphasis on monetising everything
	- Public ownership
	- Better access
	- More inclusive
	-
