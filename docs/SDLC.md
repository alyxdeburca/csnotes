## SDLC - Create

- Most labour-intensive stage
- Programmers write the code
- UI designers create the interface
- (Unit) Testing – Very important at this stage
- Users may be involved as 'Consultants!'
- May involve re-design and re-writing – Iteration
- Patience required!
- Flexibility required!

## SDLC – Evaluate

- Testing essential to ensure
  - Functionality
  - Correctness
  - Consistency
- Unit testing should be done at the Coding stage
- More testing remains to be done...
  - Functionality testing
  - System testing
  - Acceptance testing

- Test Data:
  - Conditions/Inputs that produce a known result
  - Used to test every part of the software
  - Must be prepared in advance and independently
- Testing can be manual or automatic
- Should include
  - Normal values
  - Incorrect values
  - Extreme values
  - Boundary values

- Functional Testing
  - Compliance with specification – fit for purpose
  - Usability
    - User friendly?
    - Intuitive
    - Easy to find ones way around the syste?
    - Accessibility – easy to access functions of systems?
    - Feedback – appropriate and useful error messages
    - Recovery from errors – does it crash?
    - Security? Too easy to access system?
  - Identify **Functions** or **Features** of the system
  - Then for each one:
    - Create test data
    - Determine expected output
    - Carry out test(s)
    - Compare actual with expected results
- System testing
  - Looks at complete system rather than Functions
  - Ensures conformance with agreed specification
  - Alpha testing
    - In-house
    - Satisfies technical team that the system works
  - Beta testing
    - On-site
    - Gives assurance to the client that system is fit for purpose
- Alpha testing
  - In-house
  - First line of defence!
  - Test as many paths through the system as possible
  - Find bugs before the users discover them!
- Beta testing
  - On-site
  - Early (Beta) version of system released to users.
  - Users test the system in 'real-life' environment
  - Record errors and notify development team
  - Wider range of use-cases and scenarios can be tested
  - Continues until all (identified!) issues have been resolved
  - When all issues have been resolved, the user will be asked to Sign-off
  - Aka. Acceptance testing
- Evaluation stage
  - After Alpha and Beta testing has been completed
  - Product has probably been signed-off and in use
  - Has been deemed 'Acceptable' but not perfect!
  - Often a trade-off of Features vs Time available
  - Modifications may be required
  - Unforeseen 'features' may have been deferred to avoid Scope-Creep
  - Might be time to plan Version 2
- Evaluation Stage – Questions to be Asked
  - What about the Product?
  - Does the system do what was required?
  - How well does it meet requirements... in terms of:
    - Introduction to workplace?
    - User Ownership?
    - Response time?
    - Coping with data volumes?
    - Reliability?
    - Usability?
  - What about the Project?
    - How about Cost vs Budget?
    - What about Value for Money?
    - How did we score on the timescale?
    - How easy to maintain and enhance the systems?
    - How long will it last?
    - What have we learned from the project?

## SDLC – Document

- Effective Communication is KEY
- Informal Communication:
  - Meetings, Phone calls, email, etc.
- Formal Communications:
  - Project documentation, Feasibility study, Project plan, etc.
- Informal Communications:
  - Meetings – Minutes should be recorded and made available as required
    - Decisions made
    - Actions agreed
    - Issues to be resolved
  - Phone Calls
    - Any important or relevant phone calls should be logged in a diary or similar
  - Correspondence
    - Letters
    - Emails and other messaging
  - Changes to Requirements, Plan or Design should be documented
- Project Documentation
  - Feasibility study
  - Requirements specification
  - Design documents
  - Project plan
  - Source code – including Libraries, etc.
  - NOTE: Code should include Comments and other technical support
  - Test plans and Test data
  - Test results and details
  - System Documentation
  - Installation and Setup guides
  - Training and End-user Documentation
  - Evaluation report

- Reporting
  - Inform stakeholders of progress
  - Regularly!
  - Manage expectations
  - Maintains Trust and Confidence

- Reporting
  - Avoid technical language (jargon) where possible
  - Identify and report potential problems ASAP
  - Timely information helps timely intervention
  - Reduces risk of Cost and Time overruns

## Software Project

- Usually, a Need or Problem is identified
  - Urgent response needed
  - Competitive factors
  - Changing marketplace
  - Changes in legislation
  - Need to control costs
  - Improve lead / response time
  - GDPR
  - etc..
- The main players:
  - Business Analyst
  - Project manager
  - Systems Analyst
  - Designer
  - Developer
  - Tester
  - User liaison and training
  - Administrative support
